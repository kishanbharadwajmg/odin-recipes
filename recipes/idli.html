  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>LSoft, fluffy, and steamed rice cakes made from fermented rice and urad dal batter</p>
  <p> They are a popular South Indian breakfast item, often served with sambar (lentil soup) and coconut chutney.</p>
  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup urad dal (split black gram)</li>
    <li>2 cups idli rice or parboiled rice</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional)</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Water as needed</li>
  </ul>
  <h1> Steps </h1>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Soak Ingredients:</strong> Rinse the urad dal and rice separately. Soak them in water for at least 6 hours or overnight. Add fenugreek seeds to the urad dal while soaking.</li>
  <li><strong>Grind Batter:</strong> Drain the soaked urad dal and rice. Grind the urad dal to a smooth, fluffy paste using a little water as needed. Grind the rice to a slightly coarse paste. Combine both pastes in a large bowl. Mix well, cover, and let it ferment in a warm place for 12-24 hours or until the batter doubles in volume and is slightly bubbly.</li>
  <li><strong>Prepare Idlis:</strong> Grease idli molds with a little oil. Pour the fermented batter into the molds. Steam in an idli steamer or pressure cooker (without the pressure) for about 10-15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.</li>
  <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Let the idlis cool slightly before removing them from the molds. Serve warm with sambar and coconut chutney.</li>
