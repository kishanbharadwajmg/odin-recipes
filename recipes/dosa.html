  <h1>Description</h1>
  <p>Crispy, thin pancakes made from a fermented rice and urad dal batter.</p>
  <p> They are typically served with sambar and coconut chutney and can be enjoyed plain or with various fillings like potatoes or onions.</p>

  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup urad dal (split black gram)</li>
    <li>2 cups idli rice or parboiled rice</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds (optional)</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>Water as needed</li>
  </ul>
  <h1> Steps </h1>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Prepare Batter:</strong> If you havenâ€™t already, soak urad dal and rice as described for idli. Grind soaked urad dal and rice together with enough water to form a smooth, slightly thick batter. The consistency should be pourable but not too runny. Ferment the batter as described for idli.</li>
  <li><strong>Cook Dosas:</strong> Heat a non-stick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Lightly grease the pan with oil or ghee. Pour a ladleful of batter onto the pan and spread it in a circular motion to form a thin, even layer. Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges. Cook until the dosa becomes golden brown and crispy, and then flip if you prefer a softer texture. Remove from the pan and keep warm.</li>
  <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve dosas hot with sambar and coconut chutney.</li>
  </ol>
